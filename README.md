# Auto-Text-Preprocessing


Hi folks,



I have created a simple text preprocessing application which you can access by clicking on this link https://text-preprocess.streamlit.app


Just a simple walkthrough:

* The objective of this application is to let the users upload their files and preprocess the target columns as per their customizations. Basically automating an important step in NLP.
* I have provided a tab where you can enter some text and play around with the various preprocessing options I have given so as to know which options work best for your usecase!
* Once you are confident, Move over to the file upload tab and upload your file. Select the target column to preprocess and sit back and relax! 
* Once done, you can download the preprocessed file back to your local machine!



Disclaimer :

I used the popular libraries to make this very simple application. Do let me know if you need me to add any additional features. :)
